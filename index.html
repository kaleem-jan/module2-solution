      <p>There are different seasons in a year, summer, monsoon, autumn, winter, and spring. With each season, 
        we witness certain changes not only in our lives but also on our Earth. Seasons are reminders to us
        that change is inevitable. India is one of the few countries that experiences all six seasons in a 
        year. They are summer, monsoon, autumn, pre-winter winter, and spring. However, these seasons vary
        from region to region due to factors like latitude, longitude, topography, and environmental factors.
        per the Hindu calendar, each season is divided into two months throughout the year.
